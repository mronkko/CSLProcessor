By default, the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective, meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct. Many times, though, the nature of the construct is not reflective, but rather formative. Formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa. In this research, we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers. By examining complete volumes of MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the last 3 years, we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative constructs. For scientific results to be valid, we argue that researchers must properly specify formative constructs. This paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative constructs on both Type I and Type II errors. To avoid these errors, the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative constructs. We also discuss how to address formative constructs within a research model after they are specified.

This assumes these measures possess high convergent validity. However, proxies\u2014alternative measures of the same construct\u2014are rarely perfectly convergent. Although some convergence is preferred to none, this study demonstrates that even modest departures from perfect convergent validity can result in substantial differences in the magnitudes of findings, creating challenges for the accumulation and interpretation of research. Using data from published research, the authors find that substantial differences in findings between studies using desired and proxy variables occur even at levels of convergent validity as high as r = .85. Implications of using measures with less-than-ideal convergent validity for the interpretability of research results are examined. Convergent validities above r = .70 are recommended, whereas those below r = .50 should be avoided. Researchers are encouraged to develop and report convergent validity data.","publicationTitle":"Organizational Research Methods","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1177/1094428110392383","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://orm.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/12/28/1094428110392383.abstract","accessDate":"2010-12-31 07:02:51","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Highwire 2.0","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[]}

A Monte Carlo assessment of the new sampling variance formula has resulted in the following conclusions. First, the formula-based (analytical) sampling variances were very close to the empirically derived sampling variances based on 5,000 replications. Second, the sampling variance formula was quite robust against committing Type I errors. Third, the statistical power was low to moderate in distinguishing between two unattenuated and unrestricted population correlations. Fourth, the new formula produced smaller sampling variances; was closer to nominal alpha levels; and was more powerful when sample size increased, when the population correlation coefficient increased, when range restriction was less severe, and when both the criterion and predictor reliabilities increased.","publicationTitle":"Applied Psychological Measurement","volume":"27","issue":"1","pages":"52 -71","date":"January 01 , 2003","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1177/0146621602239476","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://apm.sagepub.com/content/27/1/52.abstract","accessDate":"2011-01-07 11:09:06","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Highwire 2.0","callNumber":"0000","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[]}

Past attempts to determine confidence intervals for CAME are summarized and their limitations discussed. The author suggests that inference requires confidence sets that demarcate those population parameters likely to have produced an obtained value--rather than indicating the samples likely to be produced by a given population--and that most researchers tend to confuse these 2 types of confidence sets. Three different Monte-Carlo methods are presented, each offering a different way of examining confidence sets under the new conceptualization. Exploring the implications of these approaches for CAME suggests potential consequences for other statistics.","publicationTitle":"Psychological Methods","volume":"10","issue":"2","pages":"206-226","date":"June 2005","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1037/1082-989X.10.2.206","ISSN":"1082-989X","shortTitle":"The Correction for Attenuation Due to Measurement Error","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WYR-4GK1CT3-5/2/2dec893622cdf66f89617ed1afd0d45e","accessDate":"2011-01-07 11:01:55","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","callNumber":"0000","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"attenuation","type":1},{"tag":"confidence interval","type":1},{"tag":"correction for measurement error","type":1},{"tag":"correlation","type":1},{"tag":"fiducial","type":1}]}

As expected, correlation coefficients uncorrected for measurement error are systematically biased downward. For the data conditions examined, the two correction approaches provided not only near identical and unbiased estimates but also near identical confidence intervals for the sampling distribution of the corrected correlation coefficients. The highly comparable results from the two approaches suggest that these two approacheswork equally well for these data. It is pointed out that the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) modeling approach may be less applicable because of more difficult data conditions at the item level in research practice. The findings point to the importance of reporting measurement reliability information in substantive research. The findings further suggest that, in research practice, correction for attenuation should be considered when information about score reliability is available.","publicationTitle":"Educational and Psychological Measurement","volume":"63","issue":"6","pages":"915 -930","date":"December 01 , 2003","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"10.1177/0013164403251319","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Two Approaches for Correcting Correlation Attenuation Caused by Measurement Error","url":"http://epm.sagepub.com/content/63/6/915.abstract","accessDate":"2011-01-07 11:05:14","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Highwire 2.0","callNumber":"0000","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[]}

In this article, the authors investigated the performance of AFIs with simulated data known to not be invariant. The results indicate that AFIs are much less sensitive to sample size and are more sensitive to a lack of invariance than chi-square-based tests of MI. The authors suggest reporting differences in comparative fit index (CFI) and R. P. McDonald's (1989) noncentrality index (NCI) to evaluate whether MI exists. Although a general value of change in CFI (.002) seemed to perform well in the analyses, condition specific change in McDonald's NCI values exhibited better performance than a single change in McDonald's NCI value.

However, we demonstrate here why the Little et al. approach obviates this requirement that heretofore was thought to be necessary for all constrained, partially constrained, and unconstrained approaches. Both the Marsh et al. and Little et al. unconstrained approaches typically result in similar results and are much easier to implement than traditional constrained approaches. They differ primarily in that the Little et al. approach is a 2-step approach involving a potentially large number of separate analyses prior to estimating the structural equation model that apparently does not require the estimation of a mean structure, whereas the Marsh et al. approach is a 1-step approach that includes a mean structure.

This particular technique provides identical model fit as traditional methods (e.g., the marker variable method), but it allows one to estimate the latent parameters in a nonarbitrary metric that reflects the metric of the measured indicators. This technique, therefore, is particularly useful for mean and covariance structures (MACS) analyses, where the means of the indicators and latent constructs are of key interest. By introducing this alternative method of identification and scale setting, researchers are provided with an additional tool for conducting MACS analyses that provides a meaningful and nonarbitrary scale for the estimates of the latent variable parameters. Importantly, this tool can be used with single-group single-occasion models as well as with multiple-group models, multiple-occasion models, or both.

After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses.

The proposed method for representing latent variable interactions has potential advantages over extant procedures. First, the latent variable interaction is derived from the observed covariation pattern among all possible indicators of the interaction. Second, no constraints on particular estimated parameters need to be placed. Third, no recalculations of parameters are required. Fourth, model estimates are stable and interpretable. In our view, the orthogonalizing approach is technically and conceptually straightforward, can be estimated using any structural equation modeling software package, and has direct practical interpretation of parameter estimates. Its behavior in terms of model fit and estimated standard errors is very reasonable, and it can be readily generalized to other types of latent variables where nonlinearity or collinearity are involved (e.g., powered variables).

This lack of invariance due to model identification creates the possibility that different analysts may reach different conclusions about a parameter's significance level even though they test equivalent models on the same data.

One particular survey research approach can be described as follows: (1) survey questionnaires involving perceptual questions about a situational issue are administered to key informants, one key informant per unit of analysis; (2) key informants vary in a transparent manner across units of analysis such that groups of these key informants are discernible; and (3) perceptual responses, after data collection, are then pooled to create a single larger data set for subsequent statistical manipulations. In this methodological note, we draw attention to this particular survey research approach and ask the question: When is it appropriate to pool data provided by key informants with transparently different demographics across units of analysis so as to create a single larger data set for statistical manipulations? We use a simple example and data from a published study to motivate the relevance and gravity of this methodological question. Offering the concept and empirical assessment of measurement equivalence as the answer to this methodological question of data pooling, we prescribe and demonstrate, with the total quality management\u2192customer satisfaction relationship, the procedural steps for evaluating the seven subdimensions of measurement equivalence. In conclusion, we highlight methods that should be adopted, before data collection, to minimize the risk of violating measurement equivalence.
